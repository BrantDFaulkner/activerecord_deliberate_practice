ActiveRecord Deliberate Practice
================================

ActiveRecord is a foundational part of most Rails apps, so in order to be professional Rails developers,
we need to hone our knowledge and ability with it. To do this, we'll practice it, focusing deliberately
on small parts of its functionality, with the explicit intent of improving within that limited domain.

This allows us to make the most progress with the least amount of effort.
Deliberate practice [1](http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/),

is shockingly more effective than all other forms of practice.


How to use the repo:
--------------------

Get the dependencies:

```
$ bundle install
```

Run the tests in orer:

```
$ mrspec 1_migrations_create_table.rb
```

Find the section "Your work goes here!", that's where you're going to
put your code.

Read the description of what you need to do, look at the example to see
one that is similar. Then write your code there so that it meets the requirements.

You may need to follow the references, you may not.
Either way, try guessing at what
you think it might be before you try to look them up.

**Your goal is to be able to perform these tasks later, without reference.**
